        Pitta dosha is the Ayurvedic mind-body element associated with fire and water.<br><br>
        Do you often feel hot, irritable, or “hangry?” Is your skin sensitive or prone to breakouts, rashes, and irritation? Do you sometimes have excess stomach acid or trouble falling asleep at night? If some of these things sound familiar, you might have a Pitta dosha imbalance—or, you might be a fiery, passionate Pitta dosha mind-body type.
        <br>One of the foundational principles of Ayurveda is that “like increases like,” and opposites balance. Therefore, because Pitta dosha is hot, sharp, and oily in nature, it benefits from things that are cooling and soothing.

        </span>

            Pitta types generally love good and interesting debates. Serious debates and arguments are sure to get the Pitta rising. If your Pitta is high, it is important for you to stay away from serious debates and rather keep themselves among happy and joyful people and converse. Pitta types hate the word “No”, hence should be placed among more agreeable people. If ever you indulge in a conflicting conversation; step away, take a walk and come back to the conversation when your mind is more balanced and debate without taking stress in order to balance your Pitta.
